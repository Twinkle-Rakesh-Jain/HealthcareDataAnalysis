Project Description:
Title: Analyzing Healthcare Data in Tableau: Optimizing Hospital Operations

In this case study, we delved into the realm of healthcare data analysis to enhance the efficiency of hospital operations. Our primary objective was to gain insights into effective hip replacement surgeries across the state of New York by conducting comprehensive exploratory analysis on patient-level data spanning a single year.

To achieve this, we employed Tableau to conduct initial exploratory analysis on patient-level data from various hospitals. By utilizing complex calculated fields with fixed Level of Detail (LOD) expressions, we compared the average length of stay (LOS) and discharge costs across different hospitals. This allowed us to address critical business questions, such as identifying hospitals with the highest average cost and length of stay relative to the state average, pinpointing outliers, and determining the key factors influencing LOS and costs.

Through scatter plot correlation analysis, we uncovered that neither the costs nor LOS per patient were heavily influenced by the number of surgeons per patient. In our quest for understanding other influential factors, we explored variables such as severity of illness, patient disposition, and diagnosis descriptions. Our analysis revealed that average LOS and costs tend to be higher under the following conditions:

1) Extreme illness severity
2) Diagnoses linked to bone cancer
3) Patient disposition requiring specialized care
4) Hospitals located in New York City
   
To effectively communicate our findings, we developed dynamic and interactive dashboards dedicated to LOS and cost analysis. These dashboards feature key performance indicators (KPIs) such as average length of stay, number of discharges, number of hospitals, and average cost per discharge. By leveraging visualization and interactivity, our dashboards provide stakeholders with actionable insights to optimize hospital operations and enhance patient care outcomes.
